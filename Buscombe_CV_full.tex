%\section{\mysidestyle Research\\Interests}
%     %I am a geomorphologist/sedimentologist with a principal research interest in sediment dynamics, which includes the physical and biochemical makeup of sediment beds in a range of aquatic environments, the role of sediment heterogeneity in the physics of sediment transport, and the morphodynamics (both micro- and macro-scale) that result from sediment transport, sedimentation, stratigraphy and geomorphological forms. I study the complex inter-relations between fluid flows, geomorphology, sediment transport and sedimentology. I investigate these processes by developing novel field-deployed optical and acoustic imaging systems, and computational algorithms for small-scale sediment hydroacoustics, in-situ particle and bed imaging and flow-field/turbulence measurements.

%%I was

%%My doctoral research was on the mechanics of gravel transport under energetic water waves and
%%gravel beach morphodynamics. Since then, I have worked in various marine and riverine environments,
%%studying the complex inter-relations between fluid flows, geomorphology, sediment transport
%%and sedimentology. I have investigated these processes by developing novel field-deployed
%%optical and acoustic imaging systems, and computational algorithms for small-scale sediment hydroacoustics, in-situ particle and bed imaging and flow-field/turbulence measurements. As part of this work, I have developed
%%extensive experience with field data collection and laboratory
%%experimentation, numerical methods
%%and stochastic modeling techniques, community software development, instrument design and
%%fabrication and fundamental research in sediment
%%transport. In recent years, I have developed an interest in the role sediment heterogeneity and transport in the
%%dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.

\section{\mysidestyle Research\\Statement}
    \begin{footnotesize}
My research is interdisciplinary in sedimentology, coastal and hydraulic engineering, and
geophysics, applying methodologies ranging from field surveys and laboratory analysis to
analytical and numerical modeling. Of special interest to me is geostatistical analyses, computational geomorphology and sedimentology, stochastic modeling techniques, community software development, instrument design, and the remote characterization of
sedimentary environments, which includes sensing the properties of flows and particles at rest
and in motion, in single and multiphase flows, both terrestrial and subaqueous, by developing
and applying novel acoustics and optics instrumentation and computational algorithms

%Principally, I measure sediment: what is it made of; what lives in or on it; how it gets picked up by flows of
%air and water; how it gets deposited into landforms; how these processes evolve in time due to
%feedback processes; how it gets preserved in the rock record. The properties of sediment (grain
%size, shape, packing, cohesion, etc) fundamentally control what grows in or on it; how fast and
%far it moves; how long it stays there. These properties govern the dynamics of air and water
%turbulence; water turbidity; formation of dunes in deserts, rivers and seas; the attenuation and
%scattering of light and sound; and landform stability. Documenting and understanding how
%sediment properties change in time and space is fundamental to understanding and modeling the
%hydraulics of open channel flow; the mechanics of sediment transport in water and air; the
%evolution of landforms; and the distribution of primary producers which support ecosystems of
%all types. I am intellectually stimulated by the dynamic role of sediments in sediment transport,
%geomorphology and aquatic habitats, mediated by how sedimentary materials change in space
%and time. Measuring sediment properties (such as grain size) of a given sample is obviously wellestablished. However, measuring the properties of sediments continuously in time or in space is notoriously difficult, because it precludes physical sampling of the sediment and subsequent
%laboratory analysis, which is prohibitively time-consuming and expensive, as well as physically
%and ecologically destructive. Instead, sediment properties need to be remotely sensed.
%Traditionally, this has imposed severe limits on how sediment properties have been incorporated
%as a dynamic variable into models and understanding of physical and biological processes,
%allowing only a ‘static role’ of sedimentary materials as a boundary or context to contemporary
%earth surface and ecological processes, and the dynamics of environmental change. In reality,
%sediment is both dependent and independent variable in many of these processes, and should be
%measured and modelled continuously in time like flows of water and populations of organisms.
%Understanding these processes requires being able to measure sediments properties at high
%temporal and spatial resolution and great spatial coverage. Much of my career to date has
%therefore been devoted to developing instrumentation, computational and analytical tools which
%allow measurements of sediment at unprecedented scales and resolutions. In the coming years,
%methods for measuring the reflectance and scattering of light and/or sound to remotely
%characterize terrestrial and underwater surfaces and infer sediment properties will continue to
%mature. I wish to continue to be at the forefront of this nascent science. These techniques have
%opened up the possibility of mapping sedimentary deposits, surface roughness and depositional
%sedimentary environments over large areas, and monitoring those areas in time. Compared to a
%few discrete samples in locations accessed physically, this will provide more fundamental insight
%into geomorphological and ecological processes, by massively expanding the scope of what time
%and spatial scales and resolutions can be monitored, and could significantly alter the way in
%which environmental research is carried out.

    \section{\mysidestyle Teaching \\ Experience}
        \begin{footnotesize}

Before undertaking my PhD studies, I worked full-time for a year (2003-2004) for the Field Studies Council at Castle Head (UK), a residential outdoor education centre near Grange-over-Sands in the Lake District, UK. My duties included teaching basic ecology, geology and environmental studies to a range of age groups. These courses were mostly field and field-laboratory based. Throughout my time at Plymouth University as a PhD candidate (2004-2008), I lectured undergraduate classes (in the School of Geography) in a range of courses on coastal, glacial and fluial geomorphology, which included planning and leading field trips. I also lectured on quantitative methods and application of the scientific method. I have led laboratory classes on topics such as stratigraphic analysis of cores and particle size analysis techniques, as well as practical workshops in topographic surveying, cartographic techniques, and statistical analysis. In 2007, I organised and led a 1 day field excursion as part of a national coastal conference (YCSEC).

I had no formal teaching role as a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of California Santa Cruz (2008-2009) and subsequently at the University of Plymouth (2009-2012), however at Plymouth I did teach classes in fluid mechanics (boundary layers, turbulent flow) and coastal processes (beaches and barriers, tides). I also lectured in a short course for the UK Environment Agency on coastal sediment transport processes. The emphasis there is on the practical application of knowledge (in this case, sediment transport models). At Plymouth, I served on two graduate (Masters) student committees, both in Oceanography.

Since joining the USGS (2012 to present) again I have had no formal teaching role, however, I have lectured for NAU in EES529: Applied Remote Sensing class for the past 2 years, and in the fall 2015 semester have contributed to the "Topics in Fluvial Geomorphology" seminar (EES691). I currently serve on the committees of 4 graduate students: two Masters students at Utah State University, 1 PhD student at University of Wyoming, and 1 PhD student at Northern Arizona University. In February 2016, I will ran a Software Carpentry course for the Flagstaff science campus (a collection of geologists, ecologists, and hydrologists) on basic-intermediate level computer and data science.
