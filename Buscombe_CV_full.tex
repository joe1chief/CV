\section{\mysidestyle Research\\Interests}
     I am a geomorphologist/sedimentologist with a principal research interest in sediment dynamics, which includes the physical and biochemical makeup of sediment beds in a range of aquatic environments, the role of sediment heterogeneity in the physics of sediment transport, and the morphodynamics (both micro- and macro-scale) that result from sediment transport, sedimentation, stratigraphy and geomorphological forms. I study the complex inter-relations between fluid flows, geomorphology, sediment transport and sedimentology. I investigate these processes by developing novel field-deployed optical and acoustic imaging systems, and computational algorithms for small-scale sediment hydroacoustics, in-situ particle and bed imaging and flow-field/turbulence measurements.
